                  These are the routine tasks that you do to support your Lean culture. 
                  The principles of Lean are Respect and Continuous Improvement. Consider 
                  daily, weekly, monthly and annual tasks that you do to drive inspiration 
                  to the hearts and minds of those around you. This is done every day, every 
                  week, every month and every year. It takes the form of strategic program 
                  planning, initiative selection, improvement management and daily problem 
                  solving coaching.
